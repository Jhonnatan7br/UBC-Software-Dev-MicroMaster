ELISA BANIASSAD: So that's about as far as we
could get without knowing anything about object orientation in general or Java
in particular.
So now let's take a closer look at both of those.
We're going to start by thinking about this concept of a class, and remember,
classes were the files that lived inside of the project structure.
So you would have a class, and inside the class, you had two things.
You had data and you had behavior, so operations.

And this was the place where you could kind of store everything
related to one concept.
So if you had a concept like a dog, then you could put inside of this class
file all of the operations and behavior related to dogs.
So a dog might have an age, and it might have operations like bark and wagTail.

So that was classes.
Now, let's think about the objects in object orientation.
Classes are this static structure that lets you describe one concept,
and it kind of lets you do it in one place.
The power of object orientation is using this class
as a template for creating many instances of the same thing.
So in prior courses, what you would have done
is you would have used some predicate, like make-dog, to create
lots of instances of a dog.
And then you could call operations on those or set their data,
and they would each be individual things.
In object orientation, we have the same thing, and it's called construction.
Again, the same.
What you do there is you call a special method, called a constructor,
and you call that by saying new, using this new keyword, and then
the name of the class that you want to use as your template.
And what that does is it creates an instance of your class.
So in this case, a dog instance.
We say instance and object interchangeably.
It then copies over all of the class definitions into this instance
so it gets its own copy.
So this little dog instance would get its own age,
and it would get its own bark, and it would get its own wagTail.
Tail.
