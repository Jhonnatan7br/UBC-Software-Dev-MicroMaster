Overview
Welcome to High Level Design, the fourth module in Software Engineering: Introduction. In this module, we will explore high level design guidance with the goal of improving the evolvability and maintainability of software systems over time. We will build upon your knowledge from prior courses regarding abstraction, technical representations, coupling and cohesion, and the SOLID design principles. We will also discuss new topics such best practices for designing and using APIs and REST based systems.

Learning Goals
Learn about the techniques of structured programming, decomposition, encapsulation, information hiding, and constant change within the context of abstraction
Learn about various types of technical representations and how they provide alternate views of a system
Learn about best practices for designing APIs with optimal usability
Learn about REST development and how to work with REST based systems
Learn in more detail how coupling and cohesion affect the quality of a system's design
Learn about common design symptoms and how they can be improved by the five SOLID design principles
