REID HOLMES: Jeff Dean gave an amazing keynote in 2009
that really motivated the need to address or consider constant change
within our abstractions and designs.
What Jeff observed as the design and abstraction
level that is optimal for our current design, or a 10 times load,
is not the same as what we need for 100, 1000, or 10,000 times our current load.
As our needs evolve, so do our abstractions and designs.
But we can't just design for the end goal right at the beginning, all right.
Coming up a priori with a design that will work 10 years in the future
is extremely challenging because we're going to learn things over time.
We're going to learn how to make our abstractions and our designs better,
and that process is really how we learn how to do the right thing.
So Jeff really does advocate in this keynote, which I highly
encourage you to check out, to really think about our near and medium term
goals rather than trying to shoot the target right from the beginning.
Because this is by far the most likely way for us
to build an effective abstraction that will
allow us to get to work right away.
We don't want to spin our wheels and suffer from analysis paralysis
where we're thinking for a long time about this optimal design
when we can build something for 10 times the design now
and just learn how it works over time.
