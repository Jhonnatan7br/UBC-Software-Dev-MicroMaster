REID HOLMES: Of course, we can actually execute a design on its own.
Eventually, we need to build our systems.
While this isn't a course on software construction,
there are many soccer engineering aspects
that should be taken into account when you're constructing your system
to ensure it's long term evolvability.
In this module, we'll take a look at the impact
of nonstructural properties on the evolvability of the code that we write.
We'll also take a look at the impact static analysis
tools can have on our development pipeline
to improve the quality of our changes.
Next, we'll look at code smells, which indicate symptoms of design problems
within our implementations, and how refactoring can address these symptoms.
Finally, we'll take a look at the role of automation
within the modern software development pipeline.
