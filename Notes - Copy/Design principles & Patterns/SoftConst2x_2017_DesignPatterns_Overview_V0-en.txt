ELISA BANIASSAD: Now we are ready to talk about design patterns.
Design patterns are often described as tried and true solutions
to commonly encountered problems in object oriented design.
The great thing about these solutions that have been provided
is that they're highly principled, meaning
that if you apply them in your own system,
you'll know that your system will be readable and maintainable down
the road.
So how this came about was that software consultants and professionals
in the field, noticed that they were encountering the same problem again
and again, and they got together and formed
these solutions so that you can use them moving forward in your own designs.
There are many, many design patterns.
We're going to focus on three in this course,
and you'll be looking at more in subsequent courses.
So the ones that we're going to look at are the composite pattern, the observer
pattern, and the iterator pattern.
The composite pattern is kind of an object oriented solution
for a hierarchy.
The observer pattern is an object oriented solution
for one object getting updates from other objects.
And the iterator pattern allows us to abstract
all of the code related and iterating over a collection.
