REID HOLMES: Test-driven development or TDD
emerges a part of the Agile movement as the expectation of quality
became more and more important for software development projects.
So in the TDD world, what we want to do is
we want to build our systems with a heavy emphasis on automated unit
testing.
And what the automated tests enable us to do
is make sure not that the system is only buildable at any given time,
but that it works within the constraints of the tests
that we've written also at any given time.
These tests also give us the ability to very quickly iterate and refactor
our systems in response to customer feedback.
So automated testing is really widely employed
by essentially all Agile development projects.
The TDD really takes us to the max by saying that we
need to write our tests first, right.
So in test driven development what we do is we write our test first,
we make sure they fail, we write the code,
and then we make sure that the tests pass.
And we'll talk about this in much more detail
when we talk about system testing later on in this course.
By forcing developers to write their tests in advance,
TDD encourages developers to write code in a really testable manner, which
is a great habit to get into.
Unfortunately, it can be extremely hard for developers
to think about testing their code before they've written it.
So in practice, developers often struggle
with the whole notion of reading tests before they have an implementation
to test against.
