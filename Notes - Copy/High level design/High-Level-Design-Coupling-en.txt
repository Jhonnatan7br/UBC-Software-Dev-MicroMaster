REID HOLMES: Coupling captures how strongly connected different program
classes are to one another.
Coupling is really problematic in practice
because it has a strong influence on how maintainable and evolvable
our systems are.
Because if you have a class that's tightly coupled to another class,
making a change to that class can often induce errors in those other classes.
Also, if we go to fix a bug or add a new feature to our system,
it often means that we need to fix our code in many different places, which
can also induce bugs in those many different places.
This also adds a challenge in terms of reuse.
Because if we wanted to reuse a class that we previously
made within our new system, we might find
that it has to come along with five, or ten, or hundreds of other classes
if they're tightly bound together.
So this can be really a problem from a reuse point of view.
Finally, what we're trying to understand a system,
it's much easier to understand small independent classes than classes
that are all coupled to one another.
So if you're looking at one class, and you realize
you also need to look at this class, this class, and this class.
Suddenly, you have a whole series of code editors
open that make it really hard to reason about your system.
When we're thinking about coupling within our systems, what
we want to really do is we want to minimize the interfaces that exist
between different program elements.
We also want to minimize the complexity of those interfaces,
so that they only reveal the minimal surface that's
required to provide the functionality that's needed.
Finally, we also want to minimize as much as possible
the control flow constraints that exist between modules.
