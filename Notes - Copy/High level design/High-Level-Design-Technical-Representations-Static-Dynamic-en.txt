REID HOLMES: We most commonly think about the source code
when we think about our software systems.
And the reason our thoughts travel the code so quickly is there's a lot of it.
There's thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions
of lines of code in our system.
And anytime we want to add a new feature, we have to add new code.
And anytime we want to fix a bug, we need to modify some existing code.
But the code alone doesn't give an accurate representation
of what's going on within our systems.
We also need to spend time considering how the system executes.
The reason we need to think about the execution of our systems
is because the execution is what actually gives value.
As a user, you don't care what the code looks like.
You only care that the system does what you want.
It's those behaviors and actions that matter to you as a user.
And as a developer, you only get paid if your users are happy.
So we need to make sure that the behaviors in our system are correct.
And this is one reason why debuggers are so popular.
We use the buggers to pause the execution of our code
so we can examine the state and figure out what's going on at runtime.
So when we think about our systems, it's really important
that we both think about the static structure,
but also spend a bit of time trying to internalize the dynamic behavior
of net system at runtime.
