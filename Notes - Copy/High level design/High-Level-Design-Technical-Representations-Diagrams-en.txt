REID HOLMES: When we're communicating our designs, we often use diagramming.
Diagrams are great because we can go and write a bunch of boxes and arrows
on a white board and have a conversation with multiple developers
or different stakeholders in a concrete way.
So when we make our diagrams, the first thing we want them to be
is we want them to be concrete.

And this is really why we like diagrams.
They give us an artifact that we can look at and debate
and have conversation about.
So they really start to clarify information that might otherwise be
somewhat hidden within a specification.
These diagrams aren't without their own risks.
So when we make our diagrams, we also want to make sure
that they're not ambiguous.

So this goes along with being concrete.
But it's important that when we start to write out our diagrams,
they contain those key details that we want to have discussions about.
If you go and you leave something off that's important,
ends up being important, it can make it really hard
to have an accurate and useful conversation.
And bring us to our next point.
So the diagrams we build really need to be accurate.

So that means that they're correct within a given tolerance.
This makes it a lot easier for the developer to build the system.
And finally, the diagram should be precise.

So again, imprecise diagrams go and make it
so that developers who are given a design based on the diagrams
that you've had debates about will go and build the wrong thing.
So we want our diagrams to be concrete, as unambiguous as possible, accurate,
and precise.
