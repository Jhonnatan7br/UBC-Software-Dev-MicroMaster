ELISA BANIASSAD: So now let's take a look
at how this looks right in our IDE.
We've started a class called IntegerSet, and we've
started a model package in which to store our IntegerSet definition.
So we've put all the methods in that we've specified, basically just
insert and remove.
And remember that we have all of our specification in here,
as well as comments right above the method signature.
So we've got our //MODIFIES: this in both cases, and the //EFFECTS:.
Which is for insert, that it inserts something,
and for remove, that it removes something.
And in neither case do we need the required statement, because as we've
talked about, neither of these methods actually has any special precondition.
OK, so now let's look into how we can use these methods
as a regular caller might use them.
