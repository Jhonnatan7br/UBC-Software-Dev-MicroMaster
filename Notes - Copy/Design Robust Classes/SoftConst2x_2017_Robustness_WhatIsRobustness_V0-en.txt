ELISA BANIASSAD: Today we're going to talk about the concept of robustness,
the idea that we want our classes to be kind of resilient when they run.
We don't want them to crash all the time because they've
reached some strange state that we didn't foresee.
You've probably experienced applications crashing on your phone
or on your computer, and usually, that's because you did a combination of things
that maybe the application didn't foresee.
Now, as developers, we want to be able to plan
not for being able to predict every single combination of things
that someone will do with our program, but instead,
being able to recover when it seems like things have reached a strange state.
In this course, we're going to look at two ways
to enhance the robustness and resilience of our programs.
First, we're going to look at ways to recover our programs
from the brink of crashing.
And that, we're going to do using exception handling.
Then, we're going to look at how to discover
potential crashing points in our code by sprinkling assertion
throughout our code to make sure that it is maintaining program invariants.
