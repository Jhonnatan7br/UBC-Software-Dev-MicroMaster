ELISA BANIASSAD: The try-catch clause actually has three parts.
It's actually try, catch, and finally.
So first you try to run the method, if an exception is thrown somewhere
in the execution of that method, then catch catches
that exception and then finally runs whether the exception is caught or not.
So basically, where it fits in our picture is kind of right here.
It just sits underneath the catch clause such that right
after the catch executes, or doesn't execute, it doesn't matter,
the finally will run before we get down to the next method.
So in manage, if the exception here was thrown,
then the exception will be thrown, then we would hit the finally,
and then the exception would be caught in main.
If we put a finally clause underneath the catch clause in main,
then the exception will be caught, the finally would run,
and then the rest of the method would run.
What we want to do now is have some finally behavior inside of our two try
catches, so we write the word finally here.
And remember that it's going to run regardless of whether the exception is
caught or not.
So in the finally, in manager.manage, we're
just going to say regardless of what happens.
And then in the zoo try-catch we'll add dot, dot, dot, profits.
Great, now we can run this and watch our finally behavior come out.
So we have everything we saw before, but we have these two new lines.
Manager says, regardless of what happens,
and that's being printed out from the try-catch block in manager.manage
before the broke exception zooms up to zoo.main And dot, dot, dot,
profits is being printed out from the try-catch in zoo.main.
Now, let's change it so that the animal does not throw the exception.
So we can rerun our code and see that no exceptional behavior is happening,
but we can still see the two finally clauses being printed out.
So we can see that the finally clause is run regardless
of what happens with the exceptions.
