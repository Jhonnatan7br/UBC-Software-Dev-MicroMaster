Reid Holmes: In addition to MVC and MVP, one
of the most popular other compound patterns in this space
is MVVM, or model view, view model.
And you can really think of this as a specialization
of MVP, where the view and the presenter have been more tightly bound, using
something called two-way data-binding.
Ultimately, if you understand how MVC and MVP works,
you can translate that knowledge into any
of these other patterns in this space, if they all really try
to decouple the views from their underlying models and business logic.
Ultimately, there's nothing magical about these patterns.
The reason that they are popular is they've just forced designers
to think really hard about what their models are,
what views they want in their system, and how
they can pull functionality out of the views
into some type of controller or presenter mechanism.
So model view controller, and model view presenter,
and all of the other meta models in this space
have really been popularized, because they
have forced developers and designers to make good design decisions.
And those good design decisions are really driven by decoupling.
By thinking about your model, and thinking about your views,
and thinking about your controllers or presenters,
you're forced to think about what these parts are independently
from one another.
And this increases their re-usability.
It increases your ability to fix bugs quickly.
And it makes it much easier to add new features to your system.
So by taking this step back and really trying
to decouple these three main aspects of your systems,
over time, the model view controller, model view presenter, model view, view
model, meta models, all of these different approaches
have shown great strength in helping designers make good design decisions
that have stood up to the test of time.
